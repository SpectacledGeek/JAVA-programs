MULTI-THREADING:
Multithreading in Java allows you to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single program. Threads are lightweight processes that can execute independently, sharing the same memory space. This concurrency can help improve the performance and responsiveness of your Java applications.

To work with multithreading in Java, you can use the `java.lang.Thread` class or the `java.util.concurrent.Executor` framework. Here's an example using the `Thread` class:

```
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the thread
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create and start the threads
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // Code to be executed in the main thread
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyThread` class extends the `Thread` class and overrides the `run()` method with the code you want to execute in the thread. The `start()` method is called on each thread object to start their execution.

Alternatively, you can implement the `java.lang.Runnable` interface and pass it to a `Thread` object. Here's an example:

```
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the thread
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create and start the threads
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // Code to be executed in the main thread
    }
}
```

In this case, the `MyRunnable` class implements the `Runnable` interface and provides the implementation for the `run()` method. The `Thread` objects are created by passing an instance of `MyRunnable` to their constructor.

Multithreading allows you to perform tasks concurrently, but it also introduces challenges such as thread synchronization, shared resource access, and potential race conditions. Java provides synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks and `java.util.concurrent` classes to help address these issues.

It's important to design and write thread-safe code when working with multiple threads to ensure correct and consistent results and avoid concurrency problems.
